# ros-mobile-robot
A tutorial on building simulated mobile robot in ROS

# Workflow
For developing a mobile-robot(we are focusing on wheeled robot), the stepwise workflow we are following is as follows

- [x] [Create basic packages](doc/create_ros_package.md)
- [ ] [Creating URDF](doc/creating_urdf.md)
- [ ] [Converting URDF for Gazebo](doc/converting_urdf.md)
- [ ] Simulating in Gazebo


## Setup
- Ubuntu installed in laptop / PC (Normally the latest stable one, at the time of writing this article, *Ubuntu 16.04*)
- Appropriate ROS distro for the Ubuntu(also the latest stable one, at this time, *ROS Kinetic Kame*)
- Around 4-8 GB RAM for running the simulation.
