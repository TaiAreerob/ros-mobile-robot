# ros-mobile-robot
A tutorial on building simulated mobile robot in ROS

# Workflow
For developing a mobile-robot(we are focusing on wheeled robot), the stepwise workflow we are following is as follows

- [ ] Create a base ros package
- [ ] Setup directory structure
- [ ] Creating URDF
- [ ] Creating launch files (RViz and Gazebo)
- [ ] Creating base controller
- [ ] Simulating in Gazebo
